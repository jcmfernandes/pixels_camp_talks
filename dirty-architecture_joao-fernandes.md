Description
-----------

It's 2017. There's a whole lot of literature on how to write good software out there. Design patterns, architectural styles, frameworks, design principles, they all promise that you will be writing better software. Books posts are continuously getting published, blog posts written, talks being delivered.

Seems like a lot of these are like fashions, they come and go.

But what if you want to get better at writing worst software? You've come to the right place. Together we will take the road less traveled. Tips on how to write bad software are like diamonds, they last forever.

Topics we will be covering (WIP agenda):

* How to choose the wrong architectural style
* Writing obscure code easily
* Making highly change-resistant software

Side effects of becoming a practitioner of this art may include (but are not limited to):

* Becoming popular at your (ex-)company
* Lots of (negative) feedback on your LinkedIn profile
* Quick pull request reviews (rejections)

Sounds like fun, doesn't it?

Disclaimer: beware that a deep misunderstanding of this talk might lead you to develop better software. So be careful, as you don't want that to happen. Neither do I.
